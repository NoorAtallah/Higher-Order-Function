# Higher-Order-Function
1- Write a function that takes an array of integers as input, iterates over the array, and returns a new array.
The returned array should contain the result of raising 2 to the power of the original input element.
2- Write a function that takes an array of numbers as input, uses map to return a new array where each element is either the string "even" or the string "odd", based on each value.
If any element in the array is not a number, the resulting array should have the string "N/A" in its place.
3- Use forEach to  Return all the names in the array 
4- Write a function named fizzbuzz that takes in an array of numbers.
Iterate over the array using forEach or map to determine the output based on several rules:
  - If a number is divisible by 3, add the word "Fizz" to the output array.
  - If the number is divisible by 5, add the word "Buzz" to the output array.
  - If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, add the phrase "Fizz Buzz" to the output array.
  - Otherwise, add the number to the output array.
Return the resulting output array.
